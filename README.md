# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a heart disease prediction model using various machine learning algorithm. The goal is to provide a reliable prediction of whether a person has heart disease based on their medical data.

## Features
- Uses various algorithms for classification.
- Includes preprocessing techniques for cleaning and preparing medical datasets.
- Model evaluation through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from online. It includes attributes like:
- Age (`age`)
- Sex (`sex`)
- Chest Pain Type (`cp`)
- Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`)
- Serum Cholesterol (`chol`)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`)
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (`restecg`)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`)
- Exercise-Induced Angina (`exang`)
- ST Depression (`oldpeak`)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (`slope`)
- Number of Major Vessels (`ca`)
- Thalassemia (`thal`)

(Ensure the dataset is in `.csv` format and includes all necessary fields for analysis.)

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Optimize the Random Forest hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
- Add more diverse datasets for better generalization.
